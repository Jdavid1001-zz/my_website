Too often, ASG officials forget that they are students serving students. ASG needs to be accountable to the student body to be truly representative and to earn the trust necessary to implement transformative initiatives. </p> <p> For us, accountability starts with a focus on setting goals that ASG can reasonably accomplish. ASG officials are not interns for admin. We need to be able to challenge the administration on behalf of students and institutionalize ways for students to push back against misplaced administration will, which means that we cannot be beholden to admin for the success or failure of their programs. </p> <p> Therefore, each quarter we will release a “100-day plan” of initiatives developed with the student body that do not require administrative approval to accomplish. This will obligate us to work with student leaders outside of ASG to develop policy, empower students to hold us accountable for broken promises, and prove our worth as advocate for students. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="accessibility point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <div class="text"> <p> Students cannot hold ASG accountable if they don’t have access to ASG institutions and initiatives in the first place. We are committed to meeting students where they are. We need to build the strong relationships with student leaders that will allow us to foreground their expertise in our policymaking and we have three immediate fixes: </p> <ol> <li> First, we will amend the ASG constitution to empower student group presidents to elect the Student Activities Vice President. The SAVP should earn the trust of student leaders before being given the responsibility to represent them in ASG. </li> <li> Second, we will expand the role of the Speaker of the Senate to allow them to serve as a mediator for disputes between student groups. Currently, there is no trusted third-party resource for student groups who come into conflict with each other. We think that the Speaker of the Senate is ideally suited to take on this responsibility and be proactive in establishing relationships with students across campus. These relationships are crucial in order for students to trust their fellow student to govern senate meetings and debates. Simple things like holding meetings outside Norris go along way in building trust. </li> <li> Third, we will shift correspondence with ASG members to already easily-accessible forms of social media, like Facebook and Twitter, to better interface with students. If we are elected, then with the simple #ASGListen, your complaint, compliment, or criticism will be heard and addressed! Why this shift? Because we believe students should not have to go digging to make their voices heard. Everybody is already on Facebook, so we should be more active there too. </li> </ol> </div> </div> </section> <section class="opportunity point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Opportunity</h2> <div class="text"> <p> Opportunity is the ultimate aim of our vision. Our passionate commitment to accountability and tireless pursuit of accessibility will extend the opportunity to shape the direction of ASG to more students than ever before. We are excited to work with students to implement the changes that they want to see happen. </p> <p> When it comes to the issues that students care about the most, our vision demands a simple philosophy: listen, then lead. Below, you can read some of our ideas for how we think that ASG can give students the opportunity to ensure that their expertise is given the respect that it deserves when ASG tackles issues that affect them. </p> </div> </div> </section> </div> </main>
