<main class="issues" loader> <div class="content"> <section class="header-point point"> <div class="point-content"> <h1>Key Issues We Will Address</h1> <div class="text"> <p> Here are what our Plan for Action looks like on Key Issues that ASG can take on in the upcoming year. These aren’t promises but rather previews: a preview of what our leadership of ASG will look like. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="sustainability point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Sustainability</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> Right now there is a lack of comprehensive understanding amongst administrators about the urgency of sustainability. The spectre of climate change is real and to dilly dally on action is akin to denying our hand in the problem. ASG has an obligation to explore the intersection of sustainable practices in our academics and campus life. </p> <p> Our focus as leaders will be building on our culture of sustainability to try and widen the scope of pre-existing best practices while also bringing new innovation. We want to see an increase in quantity and attention for sustainable programming on campus, curriculum changes with an emphasis on teaching and interrogating sustainability, and renewed pressure for simple sustainability measures like energy and water consumption. This means expanding pre-existing Environmental History and Environmental Policy and Culture major/minor options into a broader Environmental Studies program. Also, we should pursue what sustainability programming might look like during Wildcat Welcome. </p> <p> Recognizing the urgency of climate change is not easy, as the short-term seems more expedient and beneficial. This is why a concentrated effort of pressure on administrators acting sustainable in name only is the way to push forward. Student education leads to student consensus and that will pave the way for things like more water bottle stations or programmatic additions. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="diversity-and-inclusion point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Diversity &plus; Inclusion</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> Colleges must work to include diverse student perspectives and backgrounds in order to fulfill their educational mission, a realization that Northwestern seems to understand. But diversity and inclusion go beyond incorporating student identities as data points. Rather, diversity and inclusion are words that mean to connote cultural expectations where student equality and safety are understood, never violated due to biased actions or expression. </p> <p> We will ensure that diversity trainings for organizations are tied to the funding process using the Peer Inclusion Educators program. ASG must continue to commit to more gender neutral housing and bathrooms. And as a perfect example of our Plan for Action already being implemented in ASG, we will fight to force the administration to listen to student voices clamoring for a U.S. specific diversity requirement in Weinberg while also working to expand that requirement to every Northwestern school. </p> <p> Each of these initiatives will require sustained commit to organizing with a wider scope. By publicizing the litany of student voices committed to creating a culture of inclusivity, administrators and students alike will not be able to ignore its importance and necessity. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="sexual-assault point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Sexual Assault</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> Sexual assault is one of the most pernicious problems on college campuses around the country, and NU is no exception. ASG has an obligation to create a thriving culture of sexual health and safety on campus, where assault is not tolerated. </p> <p> We will reach out to create a task force that will meet monthly or as needed that will include the SAVP, College Fems/SHAPE/MARS/Title IX Senator, and will be open to leaders from all sexual assault activist groups on campus. Following the expertise of the groups already doing great work and our leadership, the task force will collaborate to plan an outreach campaign to connect students with the options available to them, gather feedback on what students feel needs improvement, and then use ASG’s power to organize grassroots public pressure on the administration to fill in the gaps. We will create a special funding apportionment for sexual assault advocacy that student groups can easily apply to draw on. </p> <p> ASG must be in constant communication with students and student leaders to ensure that the work student government does to promote a sexual healthy campus is in tandem with those already doing important work. We will lead the charge because of our access, but the direction should be up to students. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="financial-accessibility point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Financial Accessibility</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> Many opportunities on campus have financial barriers to student participation. Northwestern campus life ought to be universally accessible and its ASG’s responsibility to identify places where we can improve financial access. We must continue to advocate for funding for classroom materials and offer student engagement stipends but more can be done. </p> <p> We will work to remove financial barriers that may prevent students from attending campus programming events by working with the new Student Enrichment Services Office, the Center for Student Involvement and the Norris Box Office to create the Student Events Fund and offer up to 4 tickets for eligible students per quarter. This will require all campus programming events to go through the Norris Box Office. </p> <p> We will also lobby for zero parental contribution for students with family incomes of less than $60,000 and typical assets. Many peer institutions already commit to zero parental contribution towards tuition, room or board, for families with incomes of less than $60,000. A commitment to making Northwestern more inclusive for students from lower socio-economic backgrounds requires creating institutional structures that make Northwestern more affordable. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="mental-health point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Mental Health</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> Mental health matters to every student, and ASG can help contribute to a campus culture of caring. The quarter system brings an intensity that has different effects on students but ASG has heard from students in past years the importance of mental health initiatives, and we must continue to listen. </p> <p> We need more than 12 caps sessions as students ask each year. This consistent request needs an answer other than “No” and we believe that with concentrated pressure from the student body, we can reopen dialogue and push for progress. We will also work for a better matching process for after caps sessions. Searle and Caps both have hours of operation that are inconvenient for students schedules. Students should not have to struggle to seek help and this is a simple fix that has gone unnoticed for too long. </p> <p> We will make mental health a priority across ASG committees - it shouldn’t just be a focus for student life; mental health relates to academics, accessibility &amp; inclusion, services, and more. Our emphasis on listening creates the proper collaborative environment where this type of work can be started, finished and communicated. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="academics point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Academics</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> We are students, first and foremost, and far too often undergraduate voices are left out decisions regarding academics. </p> <p> ASG must advocate for a reduction in the number of courses required to graduate.The 45 credit requirement makes it near impossible for students to incorporate different experiences, like study abroad or internships, into their Northwestern academic experience. We want to advocate for a reduction in courses required for graduation and more leniency on what remains requirements. Northwestern students choose to pursue double majors, minors, and certificates, and we want to advocate for more leniency in double-counting between different majors/minors/certificate programs. </p> <p> We will assess the existing pre-med peer mentoring program and expand to other areas. As a very pre-professional university, many students are seeking mentorship in specific career tracks. We want to create peer mentoring programs for common career paths such as non-profit, law, business/consulting, politics, and education through Northwestern Career Advancement and the Academics Committee. </p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="student-groups point"> <div class="point-content"> <h2>Student Groups</h2> <div class="highlight"></div> <div class="text"> <p> One of ASG’s primary roles is to support and advocate for student groups, yet for too many groups the funding system and resources fail to support groups’ missions. ASG should leverage its central position to serve as a facilitator for collaboration and information sharing across groups. </p> <p> We will create financial incentives to co-sponsoring, offer storage and capital improvement funding through the university so these expenditures are not hurt by a fluctuating Student Activities Fee pool, and create an application for student group membership with a common foundation. We will improve AE/GE interactions with groups by allowing groups to evaluate their own AE/GE and by creating a more transparent event evaluation system. </p> <p> ASG needs to share the resources it holds that students and student organizations need. We will solicit feedback and communicate regularly with student leaders, helped by a direct election of the SAVP and more accountability for Account Executives and Group Executives. </p> </div> </div> </section> </div> </main>
