Noah chose Northwestern because of our beautiful campus, Big Ten sports, and Northwestern’s strong Political Science and History programs. Noah’s first attempt at ASG ended in rejection, as he was not selected to be the Willard RCB Senator. Now, Noah is the Speaker of the Senate. As Speaker, Noah has helped push for direct elections of residential and off-campus Senators, making the Senate a more accessible space for students, and widening the lens of the Senate’s legislative focus. He won a Winter Campus Life Award for his work planning and leading the Senate during last quarter’s debate about divestment from six corporations working with Israel. </p> <p> Noah has also been Vice President of his fraternity, a Peer Adviser, a member of J Street Northwestern, and a member of Mayfest.
