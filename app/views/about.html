				<h6>Meet Noah</h6>
				<p>
					Originally from Lexington, Massachusetts, Noah Star is a junior Political Science and History major at Northwestern University. Noah chose Northwestern because of our beautiful campus, Big Ten sports, and Northwestern’s strong Political Science and History programs. Not to mention, that purple and white are two colors that Noah can actually see, as his favorite icebreaker fact is that he is colorblind.  Noah’s first attempt at ASG ended in rejection, as he was not selected to be the Willard RCB Senator. Noah may have “started from the bottom,” but now, he is the Speaker of the Senate. As Speaker, Noah has helped pushed for direct elections of residential and off-campus Senators, making the Senate a less-intimidating, more accessible space for students, widening the lense of the Senate’s legislative focus. He won a Winter Campus Life Award for his work planning and leading the Senate during last quarter’s debate about divestment from six corporations working with Israel. Noah has also been Vice President of his fraternity, a member of J Street Northwestern, and a member of Mayfest. He enjoys reading and listening to music, but usually only gets to do one during weeks 3-10 during any given quarter (guess which). His favorite book is Empire Falls by Richard Russo and his favorite bands are Radiohead, the National, and Grizzly Bear.

				<h6>Meet Christina</h6>
				<p>
					Born only 6 miles from Northwestern, Christina Kim now lives 719 miles away in northern Virginia. Christina has been coding since the age of 15 and continues to hack as a computer science major at Northwestern. Christina chose to Go ‘Cats to return to her roots, eat more hot dogs, enjoy Lake Michigan, and to take DTC. She got her first exposure to ASG through the President’s Leadership Initiative Committee her freshman year and is now the Vice President of Services. As VP of Services, Christina has helped bring Northwestern’s first hackathon, CourseDJ, and the Study Abroad Guide to campus. ASG Services is currently building an app to help tackle over programming by helping student groups find the best time to plan events, and a civic engagement website to connect students and student groups to volunteering organizations. Christina is currently an undergraduate researcher at Northwestern’s Delta Lab where she studies physical and situational crowdsourcing. Christina was one of the publicity co-chairs for Northwestern University’s Conference on Human Rights for this year’s conference, and is a GESI South Africa alum. She enjoys being near bodies of water, and looking at instagrams of puppies and good food.
